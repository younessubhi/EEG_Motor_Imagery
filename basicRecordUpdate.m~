%	An update on BASICRECORD script by Adnan Vilic (January 2013)
%   , updated by Alexander B. Kristefor the
%	purpose of conducting consecutive measurements on the same subject.
%   
%   A folder is created for the subject and a filename is given as
%   '.../trial#.mat' based on present files available in the folder. The
%   value of '#' is an increment of the largest numbered file already found
%   in the folder. Data is saved to the filename. The purpose is to reduce
%   the risk of overwriting a trial from the same subject.
%   
%   the 'subject' variable has to be manually updated to avoid overwriting
%   files from other subjects.
